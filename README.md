# Project-Elevate
Elevate is a web application written in Python and JavaScript that gives people struggling with mental health an easy way to reach out to their family and friends when they need support the most.  The account owner can simply supply their availability by adding entries to their personal calendar and press a single button to alert their contacts via the Twilio API to easily schedule support. Contacts can view the calendar and join an event at the click of a button. Sometimes it's difficult to ask for help, but by utilizing Elevate, you can get the support you need quickly and efficiently with no questions asked.
